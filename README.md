## Problem Statement

Disparities in healthcare access, funding distribution, and emergency response remain significant between rural and urban areas across many regions. Rural communities often experience limited access to healthcare facilities, delayed emergency services, and inconsistent funding. Urban centers, despite serving dense populations, sometimes receive less funding per facility. This project addresses these challenges by analyzing healthcare infrastructure data to identify funding inefficiencies, accessibility gaps, and performance differences between urban and rural settings.

## Project Overview
  This project utilizes healthcare facility data to conduct a detailed analysis of the distribution, funding patterns, efficiency, and emergency response times across urban and rural areas. Through a dynamic Power BI dashboard, the project visualizes key disparities, uncovers funding inefficiencies, and delivers actionable insights to guide policy decisions and promote equitable access to quality healthcare services.

## Objectives

1. Compare the number and types of healthcare facilities in urban vs. rural regions.
2. ⁠Analyze funding allocations across locations and facility types.
3. ⁠Examine the relationship between funding levels and emergency response times.
4. ⁠Evaluate funding efficiency using cost per patient visit.
5. ⁠Provide strategic recommendations for more equitable healthcare distribution.
 
 ## Features
 
• Urban-Rural classification based on electricity and internet availability (via DAX formula).

• ⁠Interactive Power BI dashboard with insights across key healthcare KPIs.

• ⁠Dynamic visuals for funding, facility types, patient load, and response times.

• ⁠Slicer and filter options to explore data by region, facility, and type.

## Tools and Technologies

•	Power BI – for data modeling and dashboard visualization. 

• ⁠Microsoft Excel – for initial data cleaning and transformation. 

• ⁠DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – for calculated columns. 

• ⁠GitHub – for project documentation and version control

## Key Insights
1. Emergency response times remain high, with health centers experiencing the longest delays.
2. ⁠Rural areas receive more funding than urban ones, but gaps in infrastructure and specialist availability persist.
3. ⁠Funding per patient visit is balanced, yet inefficiencies in resource allocation impact service quality.
4. ⁠Rural areas have more doctors, but urban regions may have better-equipped facilities.


## Future Directions

This project lays the groundwork for continued exploration into healthcare inequities and system optimization. Key directions moving forward include:

• Incorporating real-time healthcare data to enable dynamic monitoring of emergency response and funding efficiency.

• ⁠Expanding the dataset to include health outcomes and patient satisfaction, providing a more holistic view of healthcare quality.

• ⁠Building predictive models to forecast resource needs and identify potential gaps in service delivery based on population trends.

• ⁠Collaborating with public health agencies and policymakers to translate data-driven insights into actionable health reforms.
    
  ## How to Contribute
  
Contributions are welcome from anyone passionate about improving healthcare systems through data. Data scientists, healthcare professionals, analysts, and developers can collaborate by refining analytical methods, expanding the dataset, or offering domain insights. Whether you’re enhancing the Power BI dashboard, optimizing code, or suggesting new lines of analysis, your input is valuable. Together, we can create a more robust, impactful tool that supports data-driven decisions and promotes equitable healthcare access.
